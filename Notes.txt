    Notes:
    ------
    JSX - Use it with React to describe what the UI should look like
        https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html
        https://react.statuscode.com/
        Can be used instead of React.createElement{}
        Can handle simple ternary expressions & function calls
        Prevents Injection Attacks
        Identicle:
            const element = (
                <h1 className="greeting">
                    Hello, world!
                </h1>
            );

            AND

            const element = React.createElement(
                'h1',
                {className: 'greeting'},
                'Hello, world!'
            );
    
    Installation:
        npx - Lets you run code built with Node.js and published through the npm registry.
        Execute: npx create-react-app test-app
        Execute: cd test-app
        Execute: npm start
    
    BEM(Block Element Modifier):
        Naming convention
        Never describes nested elements more than one deep:
            As nesting gets deeper, just add additional class selectors for children
        Short for:
            Block:      A standalone entity that is meaningful on its own
            Element:    Part of a block and has no standalone meaning.
            Modifier:   Anything that changec appearance, behavior or state of 
                        a block or element
        Examples:   See images BEM1, BEM2, and BEM3
    
    Extensions:
        ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets Extension:
            Scaffold new pages with typing:
                rnfe
                rnfes
                rce 
                rcep 
                rfc 

    Tips:
        "className" replaces "class" in react JSX
        Convention: Always try to make components as small as possible
        Pressing "CTRL + SHIFT + F" will find all references to whatever is currently highlighted
